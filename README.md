# Fun Debugging Contest Website  

Welcome to this **Annoying Buggy Website**! ðŸŽ‰ This project is a spooky, interactive static website designed for a fun debugging contest hosted by GDG RCCIIT. I built it to make learning fun and chaotic! Check out the live deployment and explore the code!

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose  

Aimed at first- and second-year students, the site provides a challenging and engaging way to learn debugging, explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and get hands-on experience with GitHub workflows like raising issues and pull requests.

## ðŸŒŸ Features  

- **Scary and annoying bugs**: From BSOD pop-ups to distorted screens and more.  
- **Confusing UI elements**: Designed to challenge debugging skills.
